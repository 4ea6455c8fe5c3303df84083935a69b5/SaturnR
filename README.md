# SaturnR
A somewhat skidded recreation of the Saturn.exe Trojan by NullExceptionTSB, if you want the password, contact me on email: lovesgdimalware@gmail.com or Discord: maltest_marc15772, it is a 256 characters long alphanumeric password /w special chars, you will not bruteforce it so don't even try :)

There is a bug in 0.5 where it might not launch the trojan, so use 0.4 if that happens, I still working on that
